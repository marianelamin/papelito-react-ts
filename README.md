# papelito

Papelito is a family game played a lot in Venezuela, specially at La casa de Los Mendoza around the first week of January.

Each family adds a little tweak to it, and depending on the age of the players some rules could be added to make the game more challenging.

### Other variations

This game receives many other names and variations. I will add these variaitons down below as I find them.

Related to a turn:

1. Each turn lasts 60s, or however many minutes the players initially agreed on.
2. In a turn there is only one _active team_.
3. Active team players take on different roles each turn they play. I'll call player that is describing the papelito the _descriptor_ and player that is guessing the _guesser_.
4. If the papelito is guessed, the descriptor can pick up a new papelito, if there is any time left.
